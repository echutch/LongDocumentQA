# LongDocumentQA
## Project Description
Much information is contained in various documents that we use everyday -- such as news, stories, research papers, manuals, emails, recipies, etc. We often need to manually read/check many documents for the knowledge we need. Can we automate this knowledge acquisition process by automatically reading a document and answering questions? Given a document (e.g., a research paper), the model will read it and answer a question based on the information in the document in natural language.
